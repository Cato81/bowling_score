### Bowling score Ruby on Rails API application 
---

A bowling game involves players rolling a heavy ball down a lane to knock down ten pins arranged in a triangle.
- The goal is to score points by knocking down pins across ten frames.
- Each frame allows for up to two rolls to knock down all 10 pins.
- If you knock down all 10 pins on the first roll, it's a strike, earning 10 points plus the number of pins knocked down in the next two rolls.
- If you knock down all 10 pins across both rolls, itâ€™s a spare, giving you 10 points plus the pins knocked down in the next roll.
- If fewer than 10 pins are knocked down in a frame, you simply score the sum of those pins.
- In the 10th frame, if you get a strike or a spare, you are awarded additional rolls: two extra rolls for a strike and one extra roll for a spare, allowing a final chance to increase your score.
- A perfect game, achieved by getting a strike in every frame, results in a maximum score of 300.
